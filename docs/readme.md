# Agent P

## 1. Overview

Agent P is a lightweight, self-hosted framework designed to provide fast, intuitive, and zero-boilerplate exploration of structured data.  

The project is inspired by the simplicity and power of Odoo's list and tree views, combined with the flexibility of modern web stacks. Agent P focuses on **data understanding first**, not CRUD workflows or dashboards.

The core idea is to allow developers to:
- Define data models and relationships once
- Automatically generate powerful list and tree views
- Perform filtering, grouping, and aggregation via UI
- Avoid writing custom admin or internal tooling repeatedly

---

## 2. Motivation & Thought Process

### Problem Being Solved

Most modern frameworks lack a **generic, relationship-aware data viewer**:

- Django Admin and similar tools require heavy customization
- React-based admin frameworks require explicit UI modeling
- BI tools are heavy and not developer-centric
- Internal dashboards are repeatedly rebuilt across projects

### Key Insight

> Developers want fast insight into their data without writing UI or SQL.

Odoo demonstrates that:
- A well-designed list view can replace many dashboards
- Grouping + filtering covers most exploratory needs
- ORM-level relationship awareness is critical

Agent P extracts these ideas into a **framework-agnostic, developer-first tool**.

---

## 3. Product Vision

Agent P aims to be:

- **Universal** – works with multiple databases
- **Config-driven** – no UI or model code required initially
- **Lightweight** – single Go binary + React UI
- **Extensible** – editing, workflows, and permissions can be added later

Primary focus in early versions is **read-only data exploration**.

---

## 4. Goals & Non-Goals

### Goals
- Zero-UI-code list and tree views
- Relationship-aware querying
- Visual filtering and grouping
- Fast iteration and easy deployment

### Non-Goals (Initial Phase)
- No workflow automation
- No complex RBAC
- No chart-heavy BI features
- No spreadsheet-style data editing

---

## 5. Target Users

- Backend / full-stack developers
- Startup engineering teams
- Internal tooling teams
- Data-heavy product teams

Secondary users may include product managers or ops teams in read-only mode.

## 7. Core Design Principles

### 7.1 Config-Driven Modeling

Instead of defining models in code, Agent P uses declarative configuration files.

These definitions describe:
- Tables / collections
- Fields and types
- Relationships between models

This allows:
- Schema understanding without recompilation
- Automatic UI generation
- Backend-agnostic modeling

---

### 7.2 Relationship Awareness

Relationships are first-class citizens:
- One-to-one
- One-to-many
- Many-to-one

The system understands how to:
- Join data
- Traverse relationships
- Group by related fields

---

### 7.3 Query Abstraction

Agent P avoids raw SQL in application logic.

Queries are defined as structured objects:
- Filters
- Grouping
- Aggregations
- Pagination

These are translated by database adapters into optimized queries.

---

## 8. Backend Architecture (Golang)

### 8.1 Key Components

#### Config Parser
- Reads model definitions (JSON/YAML)
- Validates relationships
- Builds internal schema graph

#### Schema Registry
- In-memory representation of all models
- Used by ORM and API layers
- Enables relationship traversal

#### ORM / Query Engine
- Model-aware query builder
- Supports filtering, grouping, aggregation
- Generates database-specific queries

#### Database Adapter Layer
- Abstracts SQL / NoSQL differences
- PostgreSQL first
- Extensible via adapter interface

#### API Layer
- REST-based JSON APIs
- Stateless
- UI and automation friendly

---

## 9. Frontend Architecture (React)

### 9.1 Design Philosophy

- Data-first UI
- Minimal configuration
- Fast rendering for large datasets
- Keyboard and power-user friendly

---

### 9.2 Core UI Concepts

#### Model Explorer
- Lists available models
- Displays metadata and relationships

#### List View
- Tabular representation of records
- Sorting, pagination, column toggling
- Inline aggregations

#### Tree / Group View
- Hierarchical grouping
- Expandable grouped rows
- Aggregated summaries per group

#### Filter Builder
- Visual filter creation
- Generates structured query objects
- Supports AND / OR logic

---

## 10. API Design (Conceptual)

The backend exposes generic APIs such as:

- List models
- Fetch model metadata
- Execute structured queries
- Fetch paginated records

The API is intentionally generic to support:
- UI
- Automation
- Future integrations

---

## 11. Deployment Model

### Backend
- Single statically compiled Go binary
- Configuration via environment variables
- Optional Docker support

### Frontend
- React app bundled and served by backend
- Or deployed independently via CDN

---

## 12. Security Model (Early Stage)

- Read-only access by default
- Token or basic authentication
- Network-level access control

Advanced permission systems are deferred.

---

## 13. Extensibility Roadmap

### Phase 1
- Read-only data exploration
- Filters, grouping, aggregation

### Phase 2
- Inline editing
- CRUD APIs
- Form auto-generation

### Phase 3
- Permissions & RBAC
- Saved views
- Export functionality

### Phase 4
- Workflow engine
- Triggers & automation
- Webhooks and integrations

---

## 14. Summary

Agent P is a developer-first framework focused on **making data understandable with minimal effort**.

By combining:
- Config-driven modeling
- Relationship-aware querying
- Auto-generated list and tree views

Agent P aims to become a foundational tool for internal data exploration across modern software systems.
